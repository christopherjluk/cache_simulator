# Cache Simulator in PyQt
This Cache Simulator was developed for the purposes of a course project for ECE 1110: Computer Organization and Architecture at the University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of Engineering. This project was designed in Spring 2023.

## Overview
This project is a simulator to mimic the behavior of a highly parameterized and configurable cache. Input can be passed in to the cache in the form of read and write commands, and output will be displayed in the form of latency time, the status of the cache in each layer, and the hit/miss rate of each layer.
